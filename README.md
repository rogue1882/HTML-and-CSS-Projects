# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
Tech Academy class projects 
These are the HTML and CSS programs created by George Pruitt during the Tech Academy training to be included in a professional portfolio.
These include the active website at https://rogue1882.github.io
I have built a ad webpage for the Space Station and the Academy Cinema's.  
The last webpage is my About me webpage that I will continue growing.
